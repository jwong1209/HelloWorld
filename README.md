## Notes

I had difficulties with pushing to Github through the terminal due to authorization issues. After searching up the issue, I found out that I had to use a token so I regenerated my token and put it in as the password which solved the issue. I had difficulties implementing the TextInputEditText for user input but I looked at CodePath's EditText and Soft Keyboard guides to figure out how to handle the user's input and how to make the keyboard disappear.
